# Some scripts for creating, processing and wrangling word frequency lists
Just somewhere to gather together various scripts for extracting word frequencies. Poorly annotated, and very project-specific.
The Norwegian scripts start from an untidy by-word frequency table, extracted from the Norwegian national corpus and extracts letter, and ngraph (letter pair, triples etc) frequencies.
The NNC scripts start from the raw corpus and is aimed at extracting bigram (word-pair) frequencies.
